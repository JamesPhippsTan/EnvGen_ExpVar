Contains R, python, and bash scripts utilised to generate the figures and tables within 'Environmental perturbation increases gene expression variability and unmasks genetic regulation for transcriptional robustness'. It is split into the following subfolders:


Start page - helper functions and RNAseq data QC (Figure 1 and supplement).

MAD - contains variability rank analyses using the median absolute deviation metric (MAD) (Figure 2).

DE_DV - differential expression (DE) and differential variability (DV) analysis between diets (Figure 3 and supplement).

Developmental_time - used for egg-adult survival eclosion day statistics (Figure 3 and supplement).

GraVe_Mapping - Gra(mmar) Ve(qtl) mappping in each diet (Figure 4 and supplement). Snakemake pipeline in the works for better flow and ease of reproducibility.
